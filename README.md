How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure the code, program, or software is secure, one must use tests. JUnit testing ensures that certain functions of the program
are running correctly, and the program needs to compile which can only happen with a code that will compile, thus making sure there are no static errors.
This ensures it is functional and on top of that so long as data is using proper programming techniques such as getters/setters, the program will
be more secure and this can be tested by testing the functionality of the functions.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To incorporate user needs, one must take user stories to get the hard and soft requirements, then when implimenting, write tests to ensure
the needs are being met logically.
